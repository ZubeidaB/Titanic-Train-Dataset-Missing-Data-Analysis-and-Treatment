# Titanic Train Dataset: Missing Data Analysis and Treatment

Welcome to the Titanic Train Dataset: Missing Data Analysis and Treatment repository! This notebook provides a comprehensive guide to detecting, analyzing, and treating missing values in the Titanic Train dataset obtained from Kaggle. Leveraging Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, the notebook walks through various techniques for visualizing and handling missing data.

## Tasks Overview

### 1. Detecting Missing Values

- **Visualizing Missing Values:** Utilized Seaborn to create a heatmap and bar plot for visualizing missing values in the Titanic Train dataset.

### 2. Analyzing Missing Values

- **Nullity Correlation:** Explored nullity correlation to identify potential relationships between missing values in different features.
- **Attribute-wise Analysis:** Conducted attribute-wise analysis to understand the distribution of missing values with respect to other attributes.

### 3. Treating Missing Data

- **Missing Data Handling:** Imputed missing values based on insights gained from the analysis, including mean imputation for the 'Age' attribute and listwise deletion for 'Embarked'.
- **Drop Column:** Removed the 'Cabin' column due to a high percentage of missing values.

## Usage

Explore the notebook sequentially to understand the process of detecting, analyzing, and treating missing values in the Titanic Train dataset. Code snippets, visualizations, and explanations are provided to aid your understanding. Feel free to modify and experiment with the code for further learning.
